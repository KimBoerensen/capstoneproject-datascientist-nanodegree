## Summary and Project Motivation
The project was part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. The goal was to analyse customer data by Bertelsmann Arvato to identify which parts of the opulation are more likely to become customers and which ones less. Also, the goal was to develop a model predicting the likelihood of someone becoming a customer.

___

## Results
The typical Arvato customer seems to have the following features
* is relatively young and lives in a single household
* is from West Germany
* is either male or female (no gender preference)
* is from the working class and lives in a low class, high population density neighbourhood
* has a relatively low online affinity
* has a relatively low banking transaction acitivity and a rather low financial interest

Moreover, the prediction model detecting potential Arvato customers reached an AUC of 0.78 in the provided Kaggle Competition.
